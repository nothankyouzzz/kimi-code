# pi-tui upstream

The fork is the diff against the pinned upstream tree. This file records **why** those diffs exist, not where they live. Paths and function names move when upstream refactors; intents do not.

## Last Sync Point

Update this section after every sync. Do not reuse the previous range.

- **Repo:** `https://github.com/earendil-works/pi.git`
- **Subtree:** `packages/tui`
- **Commit:** `53816d7dcc5ebe3a0eedec3cd07196c3a66d83fd` (2026-09-14; v0.85.1 plus upstream main through this commit)
- **This commit is an upstream marker.** It may not exist in this repo's object database.

## Reconstruct the fork

Done when the **file list** of `packages/tui` at the Last Sync Point versus this directory is on screen, with scaffolding excluded, and every named path has been opened as a per-file diff.

```bash
sha=<sha>
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/earendil-works/pi.git "$tmp/pi"
git -C "$tmp/pi" sparse-checkout set packages/tui
git -C "$tmp/pi" fetch --depth 1 origin "$sha"
git -C "$tmp/pi" checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
diff -rq \
  --exclude package.json \
  --exclude AGENTS.md \
  --exclude UPSTREAM.md \
  --exclude CHANGELOG.md \
  --exclude vitest.config.ts \
  --exclude node_modules \
  --exclude dist \
  "$tmp/pi/packages/tui" packages/pi-tui
```

Run from the monorepo root. Replace `<sha>` with the Last Sync Point commit. Do not dump a recursive unified diff of the whole tree.

Then diff a named file yourself, for example:

```bash
diff -u "$tmp/pi/packages/tui/src/components/editor.ts" packages/pi-tui/src/components/editor.ts
```

The file list is an index, not the contract. Cards below are the contract: behaviors we must not lose.

For each per-file diff, decide only this:

- If it changes **behavior** already described by a card, keep it.
- If it changes **behavior** no card describes, do not keep it quietly — drop it or add a card.
- Otherwise leave it. Extra files are normal (style, identity, tests, docs). Do not invent cards for them, and do not revert them just to shrink the list.

If a `keep` card has no matching behavior left, mark it `absorbed` (do not delete the card).

## Add a local patch

Done when all of the following hold:

1. The behavior cannot live in `apps/kimi-code/src/tui`.
2. A new intent card is in this file (decision / why not in the app).
3. A test fails without the change and passes with it.
4. Reconstructing the fork shows a per-file diff this card explains.

Prefer an optional argument, callback, or default-off switch. Defaults match upstream.

## Sync from upstream

Done when all of the following hold:

1. The target upstream ref is written down before any copy.
2. Files are ported, not wholesale-copied. New upstream files are added explicitly and read.
3. `package.json` `name`, `exports`, `imports`, and the `test` script stay ours.
4. The fork is reconstructed against the **new** Last Sync Point. Every `keep` intent still has a matching per-file diff, or is marked `absorbed`.
5. `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/pi-tui test` passes.
6. The Last Sync Point section is updated to the new commit. Do not reuse the previous range.

When upstream reworked a module (new abstractions, renamed concepts, changed data flow), port by behavior against the intent cards. Do not merge by file identity.

## Intents

Each card: **decision** and **why not in the app**. Status is `keep` or `absorbed`.

### wide-grapheme-does-not-recurse — keep

**Decision:** A single grapheme wider than the terminal does not recurse until the stack overflows.

**Why not in the app:** Wrap lives inside the editor's line breaker, before any host render.

### non-positive-width-is-one-column — keep

**Decision:** A zero or negative reported width is treated as one column before children render.

**Why not in the app:** Width is clamped at the container entry; children never see the illegal value.

### overwide-lines-truncate — keep

**Decision:** A rendered line wider than the terminal is truncated. The renderer does not write a crash log and throw.

**Why not in the app:** The width check is on the differential render path after components return.

### negative-width-repeat-does-not-throw — keep

**Decision:** Blank lines, rules, and editor borders clamp their repeat count to ≥ 0 so a negative width does not throw.

**Why not in the app:** The `repeat` calls sit in built-in component render, not in the host.

### unchanged-lines-reuse-processed-output — keep

**Decision:** A line whose raw string is reference-identical to the previous frame reuses that frame's processed output (truncate, normalize, reset). Steady frames cost pointer compares plus work on changed lines.

**Why not in the app:** This is the main-screen render hot path. The host cannot intercept per-line processing.

### editor-history-host-hooks — keep

**Decision:** The host can filter history entries, decorate a recalled entry, and save/restore its own state next to the history draft.

**Why not in the app:** History recall mutates editor state internally; the host is not on that path unless the editor calls out.

### unbracketed-paste-enter-is-newline — keep

**Decision:** After a rapid burst of unbracketed printable characters, Enter inserts a newline instead of submitting.

**Why not in the app:** Submit-versus-newline is decided when the editor handles Enter, before any host callback.

### set-text-can-keep-paste-markers — keep

**Decision:** Replacing editor text can keep the paste-marker registry for markers that still appear in the new text.

**Why not in the app:** Upstream `setText` always clears the registry. A subclass that rewrites the buffer cannot preserve live markers without this option.

### at-completion-searches-multiple-roots — keep

**Decision:** `@` file completion searches additional workspace roots through fd and dedupes by absolute path.

**Why not in the app:** The file walker is inside the combined autocomplete provider.

### opt-in-inline-slash-autocomplete — keep

**Decision:** When enabled, `/` after whitespace mid-input or at the start of a later line opens autocomplete, and further token characters refresh the in-flight request.

**Why not in the app:** Slash detection is inside the editor's input handler, before the provider runs.

### marked-completion-enter-does-not-submit — keep

**Decision:** Autocomplete items may carry opaque host data. Confirming a host-marked item with Enter applies the completion and does not submit. Unmarked slash completions still submit on Enter.

**Why not in the app:** Enter-to-submit is handled in the editor while the completion list is open.

### autolink-stops-at-cjk-punctuation — keep

**Decision:** A bare URL followed by CJK or full-width punctuation does not swallow those characters into the link text and href. Balanced full-width parentheses stay in the URL, matching GFM's ASCII-paren rule.

**Why not in the app:** Autolink matching is in the markdown tokenizer.

### fullscreen-nav-falls-through-when-idle — keep

**Decision:** Fullscreen can swap the layout root. When the primary scroll view has nothing to scroll, viewport keys go to the focused component. Terminal focus in/out reports are not consumed, so app-level listeners still see them.

**Why not in the app:** Viewport key handling and focus-report consumption sit in the alternate-screen input path.

### input-click-uses-prompt-width — keep

**Decision:** Click-to-position in `Input` subtracts the configured prompt's visible width instead of the default two columns.

**Why not in the app:** The click-to-caret mapping is inside `Input.handleMouse`, before any host callback.

### alt-screen-search-field-forwards-mouse — keep

**Decision:** The fullscreen search component forwards pointer input on its text row to the embedded `Input` with translated coordinates, so the caret can be positioned by mouse. Navigation-button hit regions are unaffected.

**Why not in the app:** The search component and the overlay mouse dispatch both live in the library; the app cannot reach the inner `Input`.

### export-mouse-dispatch-result — keep

**Decision:** The package entry exports the `TuiMouseDispatchResult` type so hosts can type components that delegate mouse events to children.

**Why not in the app:** Type-only export surface; the app cannot name the base `Container.handleMouse` return type without it.

### mouse-dispatch-accounts-for-cropped-rows — keep

**Decision:** When the layout crops an over-tall component to keep its cursor row visible, alternate-screen mouse dispatch includes the box's `lineOffset` in the local coordinate transform and uses the uncropped rendered height, so clicks map to the rows actually displayed.

**Why not in the app:** The crop offset is computed inside the layout engine and the translation happens in the alternate-screen dispatch path.

### input-scroll-origin-aligns-to-grapheme — keep

**Decision:** The cached horizontal-scroll origin used for click mapping in `Input` is the grapheme boundary actually displayed first, not the raw column the scroller chose.

**Why not in the app:** The scroll origin is computed inside `Input.render`; the click mapper only sees the cached value.

### viewport-layout-effects — keep

**Decision:** Fullscreen hosts can register synchronous `addLayoutEffect` callbacks after layout and search reveal, before terminal output. An effect's `requestRender` coalesces into another complete layout pass without invalidating component caches; only the settled frame is written. Search keeps its selected occurrence while effect-driven layout shifts rendered rows; selections retain their content when effects only add or remove leading empty rows. Effects must converge within ten passes or rendering throws. With no effects registered, the existing rendering path is preserved.

**Why not in the app:** The settled scroll state and the opportunity to repeat layout before terminal output belong to the alternate-screen render path. Hosts cannot reach this point through component composition alone.

### image-blocks-are-structural — keep

**Decision:** A row an image block reserves is a row the placement's own `r=` control claims. Block spans are collected once from the content lines (`collectImageRowBlocks`), and each placement's declared rows are skipped so a sequence left behind inside a block cannot start a second one. A stable line array is re-scanned through an identity memo so the layout pays nothing for unchanged scroll content. The layout hands the spans it actually painted to the writer as `LayoutFrame.imageBlocks`, and the scrollbar cell of a placement row to the writer as `LayoutFrame.scrollbarCells` instead of splicing it into the line. Blankness is never inferred from rendered text, so the host's body indent, width padding, segment resets, hyperlink re-opens, and the scroll view's scrollbar glyphs cannot affect which rows a block owns or how tall it is. The fullscreen writer consumes those painted blocks: it clears the reserved rows and re-places the image whenever any row inside the block changed, it appends each registered scrollbar cell after its row content, and it treats a scrollbar cell appearing, changing, or vanishing as a row change so a hidden scrollbar cannot leave a stale glyph on a placement row. The main-screen writer expands its changed range for every placement, single-row included, so a change above a placement still re-emits it. Known limitation: an iTerm2 placement whose line is clipped out of the viewport is still not drawn at all, because that protocol has no source-rect to crop.

**Why not in the app:** The block spans and the moment they are consumed only exist in the render/layout layer — the erase pass runs in the alternate-screen renderer and the scroll re-emission scan in the layout engine, so the host cannot supply the spans or suppress the erase.
